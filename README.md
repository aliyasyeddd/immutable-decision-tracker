#  🧠Immutable Decision Tracker 

> A beginner-friendly JavaScript project to track decisions step-by-step using **Immutable.js**, ensuring past states are never lost.    

---

## 🪞 Overview  
The **Immutable Decision Tracker** helps users record and manage decisions in a clean and predictable way.  
Instead of mutating data directly, the app uses **Immutable.js** to preserve previous states, making state management safer and easier to understand.

This project is perfect for beginners who want hands-on practice with immutable data structures while building a real, functional JavaScript app.

What makes it unique is that **every update creates a new state** — nothing is overwritten.

## 🚀 Features  


- 📝 Add decisions using a simple input
- 🔒 Manage state immutably with Immutable.js
- 💾 Save decisions using `localStorage`
- 🔄 Automatically re-render UI on state changes
